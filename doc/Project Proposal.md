## Project Title
CyberBuy Electronic Supplies E-Commerce Platform


## Project Summary:
Cyberbuy is a website that aims to provide sellers and customers with a convenient way to shop for electronic supplies. Our website only allows official self-operating in order to help customers get a better understanding of the products and get relatively low prices. Also, our website only focuses on the sale of electronic products, where most customers have a strong desire to buy electronic products so that merchants can access quality customer resources. The project aims to build a professional shopping platform for electronic products, where customers can compare various brands at and choose the most suitable products for them.


## Description:
We aim at establishing an e-commerce website, that targets on selling computer and communication supplies to our customers. Our ‘start-up’ inspiration originates from existing electronics shopping platforms in the current US domestic market, like Best Buy, B&H, etc. Comparing with the existed electronic supplies shopping platform, some so-called electronic product market is a mixed bag. For instance, Best Buy sells health and wellness products even like mattresses, which has gradually evolved into a 'supermarket'. Meanwhile, many e-commerce platforms like Amazon also allow other merchants to sell similar products independently apart from proprietary trading, which results in inconsistent product prices and product qualities. Hence, we plan to only sell electronic products (such as computers, cellphones, etc.), and only allow official self-operating. Since our ‘industry’ is just getting started, we currently only sell small electronic products like computers & tablets, and communication tools like mobile phones, audios. Any large electronic appliances like washing machines, refrigerators are not in our consideration yet.

On our website, we will classify the products into several categories, such as computers and laptops, mobile phones, office supplies, and set up a menu bar and search engine on the homepage to guide users easily. Like common e-commerce websites, our platform also contains Member/User Registration function to facilitate the management of user information, as well as Order Tracking and After-Sales Service after the user places an order. Innovatively, we add a Customer Behavior Analysis on our website, which Best Buy and Amazon don’t have. Detailed introduction of Customer Behavior Analysis is written in our Usefulness interpretation below.


## Usefulness:
Similar e-commerce platforms like Best Buy, Amazon already has provided a great example supply chain that connects with manufacturer, website administrator and customer. We imitate the business model of BB and Amazon to divide the application into two core functions: inventory management and selling merchandises. At the same time, we cooperate with logistics companies to provide logistics query windows.

Additionally, our website creates some powerful features. We regularly produce sales reports for merchants to help them analyze each product. For example, merchants can see the sales comparison of each product in the report and find the reasons for improving the products that are not selling well. Also, we can provide order tracking services for merchants and customers to help users check the status of their deliveries. We plan to visualize the order tracking service in the future to better serve merchants and customers. Finally, customers and merchants will use the same platform to access our website, which can help customers and merchants communicate better.


## Realness:
For Customers’ and Administrators’ data, we will try to create some dummy data using online data generator, since our application hasn’t launched yet, that we could not get real data; meanwhile, we will also invite some of our friends to sign up as users on our website and simulate shopping on our website to get real data.

For Products’ data, we will crawl information of similar products from other shopping sites like AliExpress, Amazon.

Also, there are some public databases that we will use as a reference, like Kaggle and Google’s Dataset Search. Like on Kaggle, as we type in ‘computer selling’ in their search engine, laptop products’ basic information will appear in the webpage under the link ‘Laptop Specs and latest price’, we can also learn computer products’ selling condition through dataset ‘Amazon TOP 50 selling computer products’.
